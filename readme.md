# Growthsphere - Track Your Hair Growth Progress

Growthsphere is a self-started online web application initially designed to create a space for African American women to track their Natural hair growth progress. What's more than a web application that logs hair regimens and product outcomes, I am hoping that this application can evolve to become a space where women of color can come to share, collaborator and talk about their hair!

## Getting Started - A history of the issue

![Alt text](relative/path/to/img.jpg?raw=true "Title")

Although many blame the media for dictating how people (in particular women) behave and present themselves to the outer world, it is becoming increasingly obvious that despite it's shortcomings, the foundational way in which we consume and advertise media is not going to change. That is to say, buyers will always want to purchase that which looks the most attractive and most appealing based on the alloted price. And therefore, at least from the consumer's perspective, it should be important to note that it is not always what is being advertised that causes an issue, but how it is being promoted and to whom.

Within this broad category of marketing and advertising fall African American women and the Natural Hair Industry.

According to an Essence Panel exploring the power of the Black dollar and the extra price POC women must pay to feel beautiful, Black women already commit a huge chunk of change to the beauty industry. As Stephanie D. Smith on WWD.com writes:

> African-American women spend $7.5 billion annually on beauty products, but shell out 80 percent more money on cosmetics and twice as much on skin care products than the general market, according to the research. **That difference comes as African-American women sample many more products to find the ones that are most effective on their skin.**

So what does this tell us about Black women and how they must navigate through the beauty industry? It says that not only does there seem to be a shortage of products aimed at women of color, but also that the products that do exist do not seem to possess a base formula that can work for everyone. Instead, Black women must incorporate a strategy of trial-and-error and making homemade concoctions until they find a product that works for them.

**Enter the Youtube Product Review era of the post-Natural Hair Boom.**

What the Product Review era of Youtube did for Black women was create an audience of followers who were specifically looking for a generalized rating of a specific product. As we mentioned earlier, because Black women mostly found their products through an array of trials-and-error, Youtube provided a platform where many buyers could simply see one person try a specified product and give their personal opinion on it, while the buyer decides for themselves whether the both product reviewer's characteristics as well as their opinion of the product would be close enough to actually make a purchase.

However, after Youtube's heavy introduction of adsense and companies now specifically targeting and paying Youtubers to market and advertise their products, this process has been somewhat muddied to give a predefined opinion of whether or not the product is actually effective for women of color. In this sense, what once was a space for people to provide honest and unbiased reviews of products or regimens that actually worked has now been clouded and mixed in with the overall interpretation of what is supposed to work and what looks the prettiest in contrast to the actual contents of the product.

With all that being said, I felt like there was a strong need for an
application is this industry that sort of cut out the "middleman" or
the advertiser of said products and let women communicate with each
other more closely about their natural hair in a preserved space.
Built to resemble a mobile app but meant to behave like a forum, I
believe that Growthsphere achieves this effort by providing space
where the exact information is needed to help Black Women learn to
cater to, care for, and grow their natural hair.

## Initial Design

![Initial wireframe designed for mobile view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/projectname/branch/path/to/img.png)


- [Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io/1.0.2/docs/) - The web framework used
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
- [ROME](https://rometools.github.io/rome/) - Used to generate RSS Feeds

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Deployment
