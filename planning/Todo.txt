  Add photo to regimen form card
    Make sure photo shrinks on scroll to only take up maybe 20% height 
    of total card space when card is small and perhaps around 30% height when screen is full size

  Figure out how to implement/initialize materialize with javascript
    Right now I am only using about 30% of materialize full functionality
    I need to figure how download and use materialize css/js file without breaking the style of site
    Currently when I download the css/js files and create a custom js file to init[https://materializecss.com/auto-init.html] nothing works

Format Regimen 
    Due to time constraints the details of the regimen model and routine model should be confined and merge together
        'Building a regimen' should have all of the original form information that is commented out on the view/regimen/new
        I can edit how that information is displayed in views:
            Regimen title and purpose should be displayed as an accordion functionality
                Accordion should also have two additionl links for editing and deleting
                When the button/ is clicked accordion should open up to reveal other details
                
                refer to the planning/wireframe link for details, that should link to an adobe page with the desired mockup

Implement Create feature for [+regimen] button on profile page
    Right now the [+regimen] button leads to a form view, but when submitted does nothing (that I know of)
    It should save the data and redirect back to the profile page
